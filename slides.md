# But Will It Scale?

Opening premise. Talk about design sessions, email lists, etc.

---

# My Response

- Build It
- Deploy It
- Fix It

---

# After further discussion...

---

# Emotional topic, not a technical one

---

# Scalable → _Aweseome_

---

# Same meaning<br>more fun!

Release energy, move onto the real problems

# The Myth Of Scalability

List some key outages from big players

# The World's Worst System

- SharePoint
- Big Honkin' Enterprise Java App
- SOAP Interface

# Nothing Scales<br>Everything Scales

There's no such thing as fast, only fast enough.

## No such thing as <strike>premature</strike> optimization in nature

---

# Optimization Fixation

---

# To exist we need to

- Survive
- Reproduce

Survive: eat, not be eaten, withstand elements

---

# Survival

Olympics photo?

---

Maybe comparisons of olympic events to nature?

## Reproduction, Mate Selection

- Survivability of offspring
- Caprice

## Patterns for Building Awesome Software

- Not a Problem
- Build It Naive
- Dependencies Bad
- Think System
- Physics, Not Magic

---

# Not A Problem

---

If a problem has no solution, it may not be a problem,
but a fact--not to be solved, but to be coped with over time
— Shimon Peres (“Peres’s Law”)

---

# Build It Naive

---

Formula comparing cheap and naive with expensive and speculative

Probabilities of success vs time/cost

Optimism

---

# Dependencies Bad

---

Story of XSD outage

---

Somehow calculate the cost here!

Sign of growing monolith

---

# Think System

---

Think in terms of boundaries in time and space (runtime)

We're not talking about code abstractions

Interfaces in time and space (runtime)

---

# Physics, Not Magic

---

Pyramid of latencies

---

# Get Some Devices

Raspberry PI, Ardino, Odroid

---

# Complexity?

General place holder for talking about tipping points and other hard
to predict or reason about events. Hard to design for the future
because of this.

Use MySQL tipping point as an example.

---

# Solve Your Own Problems

This might be a good N point. It's easy to read a slide presentation
by XXX from Google and let that inform your thinking about your
problems. That's wrong.

I think this should probably be a pattern.

---

# ORMs Bad

What about this one? Abstractions that are just plain bad.

## Notes / TODO

- What about evolution here? Suitable is good, evolvable is missing
- Fix lame bullet symbol (smaller or square)
