# But Will It Scale?

## Alternatively

- Build It
- Deploy It
- Observe It
- Fix It

# Gee Thanks

## Scalable → _Awesome_

## Scalability Anti Patterns

- Not a Problem
- Build It Naive
- Dependencies Bad
- Think "System"
- Physics Not Magic

---

# Not A Problem

---

# Not A Problem... Right Now

---

# Build It Naive

---

## The Stupid Approach

- Obvious, line-of-sight
- Usually works
- Often works forever
- Cheap
- Gets you to the actual problems

---

## Pointy Hair Argument

- Cost of work is _almost always_ under estimated
- Value of work is _often_ over estimated
- Keep work as small as possible, improve incrementally

---

# Dependencies Bad

---

## Down, but how?

<!--
## Dependencies

- Moving part = part + interactions
- Part = tree of parts
- Parts you use can hurt you
- Parts you don't use can hurt you

---
-->

## Dependencies Bad

- Make due with what you have
- Fight each dependency until it overwhelms you
- When forced to give in, do it bitterly

---

# Think "System"

---

## Independencies

- Boundaries in time and space
- Not source code abstractions
- Some language cultures embrace "system", others do not

---

# Physics Not Magic

---

Pyramid of latencies
